# Wellframe Coding Challenge
This project was created with Python and Flask.

If you don't have Python or Flask you will need to install them.

Instructions:

Inside my project
1. pip install Flask
2. set FLASK_APP=app.py
3. flask run

Also you can import it into Pycharm as a Flask project and run from here

Examples of the API calls you can make are in Wellframe.postman_collection.json 
which can be imported into postman if you use that or just manually parsed and used
